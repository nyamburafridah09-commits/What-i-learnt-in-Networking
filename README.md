🌐 What I Learned About Networking – My IT & Cybersecurity Journey
Introduction
As part of my journey in Information Technology and cybersecurity, I recently focused on learning networking fundamentals. Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity because before securing systems, you must understand how devices communicate.
This article summarizes the key networking concepts I have learned so far and how they connect to security engineering.

1️⃣ What is Networking?
Networking is the process of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate and share resources such as files, printers, and internet access.
A network can be:
	• LAN (Local Area Network) – Small area (home, office)
	• WAN (Wide Area Network) – Large geographical area (e.g., the Internet)
The internet itself is the largest WAN in the world.

2️⃣ The OSI Model
One of the most important concepts I learned is the OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection model). It explains how data moves from one device to another in 7 layers:
	1. Physical
	2. Data Link
	3. Network
	4. Transport
	5. Session
	6. Presentation
	7. Application
Understanding this model helps in troubleshooting and securing networks because different attacks target different layers.
For example:
	• Network layer → IP-based attacks
	• Transport layer → Port scanning
	• Application layer → Web attacks

3️⃣ TCP/IP Model
The TCP/IP model is the practical version used on the internet. It has 4 layers:
	• Application
	• Transport
	• Internet
	• Network Access
Key protocols I learned:
	• HTTP / HTTPS
	• FTP
	• SSH
	• TCP
	• UDP
	• IP
I now understand how data is broken into packets and transmitted across networks.

4️⃣ IP Addressing
An IP address identifies a device on a network.
There are:
	• IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
	• IPv6 (longer and more secure format)
I also learned:
	• Public vs Private IP addresses
	• Subnetting basics
	• Default gateway
	• DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can locate servers.

5️⃣ Ports and Protocols
Ports allow multiple services to run on one device.
Some common ports:
	• 80 → HTTP
	• 443 → HTTPS
	• 22 → SSH
	• 21 → FTP
	• 53 → DNS
Understanding ports is very important in cybersecurity because attackers scan open ports to find vulnerabilities.

6️⃣ Networking Devices
I learned the roles of different networking devices:
	• Router → Connects different networks
	• Switch → Connects devices in a LAN
	• Firewall → Filters traffic
	• Access Point → Provides wireless connectivity
Each device plays a role in both communication and security.

7️⃣ Basic Networking Commands I Practiced
To strengthen my understanding, I practiced using:
	• ping – Test connectivity
	• ipconfig / ifconfig – View IP configuration
	• tracert / traceroute – Trace packet path
	• netstat – View network connections
	• nslookup – Query DNS
These tools help in troubleshooting and network analysis.

8️⃣ How Networking Connects to Cybersecurity
Learning networking helped me understand:
	• How attackers perform reconnaissance
	• How port scanning works
	• How firewalls filter traffic
	• How network segmentation improves security
	• How monitoring traffic helps detect intrusions
Without networking knowledge, cybersecurity would be very difficult.

🔧 Tools I Used to Practice
	• VirtualBox (for creating lab environments)
	• Wireshark (for packet analysis)
	• Cisco Packet Tracer (for network simulations)
	• Linux terminal commands
Practicing in a lab environment helped me understand theory in a practical way.

🚀 What I Plan to Learn Next
	• Advanced subnetting
	• VLANs
	• Network security monitoring
	• Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
	• Firewall configuration

Conclusion
Networking is a foundational skill in IT and cybersecurity. Understanding how devices communicate allows me to better analyze, troubleshoot, and secure systems.
This is just the beginning of my networking journey, and I look forward to building more practical labs and documenting my progress here on GitHub.
